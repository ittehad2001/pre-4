        <h2>HyperText Markup Language(HTML)</h2>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for 
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web 
            content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
             and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</h2>
        <p>
            CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language 
            for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding
             elements and is composed of these 
            “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files (. css).

        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, 
        proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use 
        and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based 
        hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server 
        software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau 
        collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was 
        not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "
        some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first 
mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising 
the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced
 by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.
  Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
         provide more flexibility and control in the 
         specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.


Separation of formatting and content also makes it 
feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for 
different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use 
with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]<br><br>

   <span id="java" > Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for 
    client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]</span>
